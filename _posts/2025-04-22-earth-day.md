Happy Earth Day! ðŸŒŽ

Our team at [Planet](https://www.planet.com) transforms satellite data into critical metrics of forest health, carbon storage, and environmental change â€” a complex scientific challenge.

But I also like to think that weâ€™re building an earth art machine. ðŸŽ¨

Iâ€™m a firm believer that if we are faithful to representing the forests as they are â€” thinking ecologically about how we handle and render our data â€” then beautiful patterns will emerge. 

Here are some visuals from our team, featuring both imagery and derived data products. I hope you enjoy them.
